### Install dependencies
```bash

$ npm  install //or you can also use yarn install instead

```
## Does the project have testing? 🧐
Of course! It has, you can run tests by using next commands

## Can I use docker? 😎

We got your back, the project already uses docker so you can build docker image 
1.  Clone this repo
2.  Run  `npm install`  to install dependencies
3.  Copy the  `.env.example`  file over to your own  `.env`  file and update the variables
4.  Run  `docker-compose up -d`  to setup local environment with Docker
5. Default user test@test.com pass: 12345678


This setup will handle hot reloading, so any updates you make to the NestJS code will update the container in realtime.
